Hi! I am a senior undergraduate at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. I major in computer science and technology at School of Electronic and Information Engineering and will be graduating in July, 2025. I will be working as a Visiting Scholar at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics, term from 15 September 2024 to 31 December 2024, on the recommendation of Professor [Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/). Currently, I am focusing on my work in analyzing the probability distributions defined by language models. I am also working as a remote intern student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), under the guidance of Professor [Hanjie Chen](https://hanjiechen.github.io/), working on a project about the estimation of uncertainty of natural language generation of LLMs.

I am actively searching for internships, master programs and PhD opportunities which can allow me to take my research into next level.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
